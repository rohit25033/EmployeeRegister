Create an Employee Dashboard Page that becomes active after the worker is selected for a job.
This dashboard allows the worker to manage their ongoing employment — track attendance, access payslips, view documents, and monitor milestones and rewards.

🧭 Page Structure
🔹 Top Navigation Tabs

The Dashboard will now appear as a new main tab alongside the existing tabs:

Home

Profile

Applied Jobs

Dashboard ✅ (new)

When the user is selected for a job (as per Prompt 4), this Dashboard tab becomes visible and accessible.

🧩 Inside the Dashboard Tab

The Dashboard will have sub-tabs displayed horizontally or as a side menu for mobile responsiveness:

Calendar — Show work schedule, shifts, and attendance days marked visually.

Attendance — Show attendance summary:

Days Worked

Days Absent

Percentage of Attendance

Documents — Section to upload/view ID proofs, contracts, offer letters, etc.

Monthly Payslips — View or download monthly payslips (placeholder buttons for now).

📆 Section 1: Calendar & Attendance Overview

At the top of the dashboard, show a summary widget:

“No. of Days Worked” → show as a bold number (e.g., “24 Days Worked”)

Below it, add a simple text line: “Keep up the good work! Consistent attendance leads to bonuses.”

Optional: Small calendar view or icon-based attendance tracker (e.g., ✅ for present, ❌ for absent).

🏁 Section 2: Milestones Tracker

Below the attendance section, show a Milestones Progress Bar or Timeline with the following stages:

Onboarding → Marked as completed ✅

6 Months → Upcoming milestone

1 Year → Future milestone

2 Years → Future milestone

Each milestone can be represented by a card or timeline node with a date estimate (placeholder).

🎁 Special Cue Card at 6-Month Milestone

When hovering over or viewing the 6 Months milestone, show a reward cue card:

🎉 Milestone Reward:
“You’ll receive a ₹1,000 Amazon voucher when you complete 6 months!”

This cue card should have a friendly illustration (like a gift box or confetti icon).

📊 Section 3: Summary Area

At the bottom or side of the Dashboard:

Quick snapshot cards for:

Current Job Role

Restaurant / Employer Name

Pay Rate

Shift Timing

Joining Date

Use clean cards with icons for each metric.
