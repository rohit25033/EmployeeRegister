Extend the QSR Owner Home Dashboard by adding a comprehensive Employee Management view, where owners can:

See all employees currently hired through Rozagaar Hub

Click on any employee card to open their detailed dashboard (same view as the employee-side dashboard)

Access help or raise queries via a “Reach Out to Us” section

Cards should be clickable, and clicking anywhere or the button opens the Employee Dashboard View (see below).

📊 On Clicking an Employee Card → Employee Dashboard View

When the QSR owner clicks “View Dashboard,” it opens a mirror version of the employee’s dashboard — the same UI and data as the employee side (to maintain transparency).

Include:

Tabs: Calendar | Attendance | Documents | Monthly Payslips

Number of working days

Milestones:

Onboarding

6 Months 🎁 (with cue card: “₹1000 Amazon Voucher Reward”)

1 Year

2 Years

Current progress status (e.g., 45/180 days completed toward 6 months milestone)

🔹 This allows the employer to track employee performance, attendance, and document submissions seamlessly.

Add a help/support option at the bottom-right of the dashboard (floating button or footer CTA).
