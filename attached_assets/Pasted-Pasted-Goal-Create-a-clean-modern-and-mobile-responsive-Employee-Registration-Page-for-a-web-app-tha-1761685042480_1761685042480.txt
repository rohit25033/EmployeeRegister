Goal:
Create a clean, modern, and mobile-responsive Employee Registration Page for a web app that connects QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) workers with verified jobs and payroll systems. The page should collect all necessary personal and professional details from the worker during sign-up.

Design & Layout

Use a multi-step form layout with progress indicator (like “Step 1 of 3”).

Keep the design minimal, professional, and user-friendly, suitable for blue-collar users (clean icons, simple words, large buttons).

Use neutral colors with accents (like orange or blue).

Each section should have short helper text or placeholders for clarity.

Use simple language labels like “Full Name” instead of “Applicant Name.”

Form Sections
🧍 Step 1: Basic Information

Full Name (text)

Age (number)

Gender (dropdown: Male / Female / Other)

Phone Number (with OTP verification placeholder)

Email Address (optional)

Password (with confirm password)

Languages Known (multi-select dropdown)

Region / City (dropdown or text input)

💼 Step 2: Work & Skill Details

Skills (multi-select dropdown — e.g., Cashier, Waiter, Kitchen Staff, Barista, Delivery, etc.)

Past Work Details (text area — name of restaurant, role, duration)

Upload Proof of Previous Work (file upload — payslips, experience letter; optional)

Upload Video Introduction (file upload — optional)

Placeholder text: “Introduce yourself in 30 seconds (optional)”

Add Certification Tags (optional badges like ‘Belgian Waffle Certified’ — editable field)

🪪 Step 3: Verification Details

Aadhaar Card Number (masked input — ####-####-####)

PAN Card Number (text input — optional)

Upload ID Proof (file upload)

Checkbox: “I agree to the Terms & Conditions and consent to data verification.” (required)

Buttons & Navigation

“Next” and “Back” buttons for step navigation

Final button: “Create My Profile” (highlighted)

On success → show confirmation message:

“✅ Your registration is complete! Verification may take up to 24 hours. You’ll be notified once approved.”

Technical & UI Notes

Ensure form validation (e.g., Aadhaar number length, phone number format, required fields).

Support image/video uploads (MP4, JPEG, PNG, PDF formats).

Include a loading spinner and progress bar during upload.

After successful registration, redirect to the Profile Dashboard page.

Output Expectation

Generate a fully functional frontend page for this registration flow, with clean UI/UX, form validations, and placeholder backend hooks (for data submission and verification).
