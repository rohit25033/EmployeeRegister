Design and build a clean, mobile-friendly Home Page for QSR employees after they’ve completed registration and clicked “Okay, Got It” on the training popup.

This page should have two main tabs — Home and Profile — allowing workers to browse jobs and view their personal details and verification status easily.

🧭 Page Structure
🔹 Top Navigation Tabs

Fixed at the top of the page with large, easy-to-tap buttons:

Home Tab: Displays available job openings with filters.

Profile Tab: Displays the worker’s submitted details and verification progress.

Active tab should be highlighted with the primary accent color.

🏠 Tab 1: Home (Job Feed Page)
Left Column: Filters (Sidebar)

Title: “Filter Jobs”

Each filter category should be collapsible or dropdown-style for mobile responsiveness.

Filters include:

Wages:

Range slider or dropdown (e.g., ₹8,000–₹20,000 per month)

Role:

Checkboxes (Barista, Helper, Waiter, Cleaner, Kitchen Staff, Cashier)

Shift Type:

Morning, Evening, Night, Flexible

At the bottom of the filter panel:

Apply Filters button (primary, full-width)

Clear All link (text style)

Right Column: Job Listings

Each Job Card should display:

⚙️ Technical & UI Notes

Ensure tab switching works smoothly with simple animations.

Filters dynamically update job listings (placeholder logic is fine).

Include placeholders for backend integration (fetchJobs(), applyForJob(), getUserProfile()).

Responsive for mobile and desktop layouts.

Smooth transitions between pages and modals.
