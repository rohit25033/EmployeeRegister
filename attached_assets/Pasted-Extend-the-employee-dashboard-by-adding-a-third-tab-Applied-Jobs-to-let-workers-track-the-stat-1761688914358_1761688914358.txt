Extend the employee dashboard by adding a third tab — “Applied Jobs” — to let workers track the status of all jobs they’ve applied for.
Also update the job cards on the Home tab so that once a worker applies, the “Apply Now” button changes to “Applied” and becomes inactive.

🧭 Page Structure
🔹 Top Navigation Tabs

Keep the three tabs fixed at the top for easy navigation:

Home — Browse available jobs

Profile — View personal and verification details

Applied Jobs — Track application statuses

Active tab should remain highlighted with the primary accent color.

🏠 Tab 1: Home (Updated Job Feed Page)

Show job cards with Apply Now button.

Once the user clicks Apply Now:

Show popup:

Title: “Application Received!”

Body: “Our team will get back to you soon with next steps for this job.”

Button: “Okay, Got It” → closes popup.

Change the “Apply Now” button on that job card to:

Text: “Applied”

Style: Greyed-out, non-clickable.

Automatically add that job to the Applied Jobs tab list (placeholder logic allowed).

👤 Tab 2: Profile

(Same as Prompt 3)
Show full profile details, verification status, and training/certification progress.

💼 Tab 3: Applied Jobs (New Tab)

Title: “My Applied Jobs”

Display a list of all jobs the worker has applied to, with their current status clearly shown.

Each Applied Job Card includes:

Restaurant / Brand Name

Role Title

Pay Rate

Shift Timing

Location

Application Status (with color-coded badges)
