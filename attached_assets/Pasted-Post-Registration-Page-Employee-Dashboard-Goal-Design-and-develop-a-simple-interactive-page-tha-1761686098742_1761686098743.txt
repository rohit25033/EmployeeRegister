Post-Registration Page (Employee Dashboard)

Goal:
Design and develop a simple, interactive page that appears right after an employee successfully registers.
This page encourages the worker to complete training and certification to unlock verified, higher-paying jobs.

Design & Layout

Clean, minimal, mobile-friendly interface.

Use friendly illustrations or icons beside each step (training and certification).

Soft colors (light grey background, white cards, blue/orange primary accent).

Page title at top: “Next Steps to Boost Your Profile”

Page Structure
✅ Section 1: Progress Headings / Checklist Boxes

Two inactive checklist boxes (greyed out, not clickable):

Complete Training

Complete Certification

Each box should have:

A small progress indicator (circle or tick icon, grey when incomplete).

A short subtext:

For Training: “Get trained and verified to become job-ready.”

For Certification: “Earn official badges to access top-paying QSR roles.”

(These boxes should visually appear as “locked” or inactive — e.g., faded or with a small lock icon.)

Section 2: Action Buttons

Two primary buttons placed below the checklist boxes:

🟧 Get Training

🟦 Get Certificate

Buttons should be styled prominently, full-width, rounded edges, large text.

On Click → Popup / Modal

When the user clicks either button, show a modal popup (centered on screen) with the following content:

Popup Title:

“We’ll Get in Touch!”

Popup Body:

“Our representative will contact you shortly to help you with your training or certification process.

Verification is optional, but completing it helps you get higher-paying and priority job matches.”

Popup Buttons:

“Okay, Got it” → closes the popup.

(Ensure the popup has smooth fade-in and fade-out animation.)

Technical & UI Notes

Include smooth transitions between register success → this page.

Use icons or subtle illustrations (like a training cap and certificate badge).

Make the two checklist boxes dynamically updatable later (to turn active when tasks complete).

Keep all text simple and conversational for semi-skilled workers.

Output Expectation

Generate a fully functional frontend page for this post-registration state with:

Clean UI/UX

Interactive modals for buttons

Placeholder functions for “marking training/certification complete” in the future.
