Design and build a clean, responsive landing page that serves as the first interaction point for two types of users:

Workers (Employees) — who want to find verified QSR jobs.

Employers (QSRs / Franchisees) — who want to hire verified staff.

This page directs each user type into their respective workflow.

Call-to-Action (CTAs)

Two large, clear CTAs at the center of the page (vertically stacked for mobile, side-by-side for desktop):

🧑‍🍳 I Want to Work

Subtext: “Find verified restaurant jobs near you.”

Button Style: Secondary (outline or neutral tone)

On Click → Redirects to the Employer (QSR/Franchisee) Registration Flow
